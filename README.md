# Substring Quadrilateral

The Substring Quadrilateral project is a Python script that reads a text file, finds the four lexicographically largest non-overlapping substrings satisfying certain conditions, computes the area and perimeter of the quadrilateral formed by these substrings, and replaces the substrings in the output file with '_____'. The project also includes unit tests using the pytest framework to validate the script's functionality.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the tests using pytest
4. To execute the script, run the following command from the terminal:
```python
python substring_quadrilateral.py input.txt output.txt
```

Replace `input.txt` with the name of your input file and `output.txt` with the desired output file name.

This project was done to showcase a programming competency for `Asaphus Gmbh`.
